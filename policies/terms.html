        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <div class="meta">Last updated: <strong>[January 9,2026] </strong></div>
        <p>
          These Terms of Service (“Terms”) explain how you may use the EarnLibr platform (“EarnLibr”, “we”, “our”, “us”). 
          By creating an account or using EarnLibr in any way, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Platform Overview</h2>
        <p>
          EarnLibr is a digital earning ecosystem that connects <strong>providers</strong> (who publish offers) with 
          <strong>promoters</strong> (who share those offers) and <strong>clients</strong> (who request services or products). 
          Our system tracks referrals, verifies completed deals, and supports commission-based payouts through 
          admin-managed payment flows.
        </p>

        <h2>2. User Roles</h2>
        <h3>2.1 Providers</h3>
        <p>Providers agree to:</p>
        <ul>

          <li>Set truthful commission rates and promotion budgets.</li>
          <li>Deliver services or products as requested by clients.</li>
          <li>Pay all weekly balances owed for completed deals when invoiced by EarnLibr.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Providers must not:</p>

          <li>Cancel valid deals solely to avoid paying commissions.</li>
          <li>Bypass the platform to pay promoters directly or avoid platform fees.</li>
          <li>Chat with clients outside the platform</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2 Promoters</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Promote offers using their unique SmartLinks only.</li>
          <li>Share information honestly without false claims or deception.</li>

          <li>Arrange off-platform deals to bypass EarnLibr.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.3 Clients</h3>
        <p>Clients agree to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide accurate information when requesting a service or product.</li>
          <li>Use offers and services in a lawful, respectful way.</li>
          <li>Understand that the platform is in no way responsible for the quality of the offers or services by the providers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.4 Admin</h3>
        <p>The Admin (EarnLibr staff) may:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Verify, approve, pause, or reject offers.</li>
          <li>Review system logs, in-app chats, and activities for security and dispute resolution.</li>
          <li>Suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms.</li>
          <li>Oversee verification, payment flows, and overall ecosystem health.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. In-App Chat & Communication</h2>
        <p>
          EarnLibr provides in-app chat so providers and clients can coordinate directly. These messages are stored 
          securely and may be reviewed by Admin <strong>only when required</strong> for disputes, security checks, or 
          policy enforcement.
        </p>
        <p>In-app chat must not be used to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Share external contact details for the purpose of bypassing EarnLibr.</li>
          <li>Harass, threaten, or abuse other users.</li>
          <li>Coordinate fraudulent activity or off-platform commission agreements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Offers & Deal Flow</h2>
        <h3>4.1 Offers</h3>
        <p>
          Providers create offers with a full description, price, commission rules, and a promotion budget. 
          Offers may be set to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Pending</strong> – awaiting admin review.</li>
          <li><strong>Active</strong> – available for promoters to share.</li>
          <li><strong>Paused</strong> – temporarily disabled.</li>
          <li><strong>Closed</strong> – ended or fully used budget.</li>
          <li><strong>Flagged</strong> – under review for possible violations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.2 Deal Completion & Cancellation</h3>
        <p>
          A deal is considered <strong>Completed</strong> when the client has requested the offer, the provider has 
          delivered the service or product,marks the deal as completed and the system has verified this, potentially including client confirmation.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a provider marks a deal as <strong>Cancelled</strong>, the system will first verify the cancellation using:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Activity logs and timestamps.</li>
          <li>In-app chat history between client and provider.</li>
          <li>Any additional internal verification signals.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A deal is <strong>not</strong> treated as cancelled until EarnLibr confirms the cancellation after this verification, 
          to protect promoters from unfair deal removal.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Payments & Withdrawals</h2>
        <h3>5.1 Provider Payments</h3>
        <p>
          Providers pay EarnLibr for verified completed deals. Payments are aggregated on a scheduled basis (e.g. weekly) 
          when their owed balance reaches or exceeds a minimum threshold set by the platform.
        </p>
        <p>Non-payment may lead to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Offer suspension or closure.</li>
          <li>Account restrictions or suspension.</li>
          <li>Negative impact on the provider’s trust score.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.2 Promoter Earnings</h3>
        <p>
          Promoters earn commission on each completed deal associated with their SmartLinks. These commissions accumulate 
          in their EarnLibr wallet. Promoters may request withdrawals once they reach the minimum withdrawal threshold.
        </p>
        <p>
          All payouts are processed by Admin and may depend on provider settlement and internal verification. 
          We reserve the right to adjust or reverse payouts resulting from fraudulent or invalid activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Promoters earnings are calculated after deduction of the platform's percentage on each commission.
        </p>
        <p>
          The platform holds the right to update the platform"s percentage on each commission at anytime which takes effect on all activities after the update,
          all promoters will be notifed.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Disputes</h2>
        <p>
          Users may open disputes if there are issues such as uncredited deals, unfair cancellations, or payment errors. 
          Admin will review relevant logs, chat records, and verification data to reach a decision.
        </p>
        <p>Admin decisions are final and binding for all parties.</p>

        <h2>7. Trust & Reputation</h2>
        <p>
          EarnLibr may maintain a <strong>Trust Score</strong> or reputation indicator for providers and promoters. 
          This may be based on:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Deal completion history.</li>
          <li>Dispute outcomes.</li>
          <li>Payment reliability.</li>
          <li>Fraud or policy violation flags.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Low trust may result in additional checks, reduced visibility, or account restrictions.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Prohibited Activities</h2>
        <p>Users must not:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Engage in fraud, fake traffic, or system abuse.</li>
          <li>Attempt to hack, reverse engineer, or damage the platform.</li>
          <li>Use multiple accounts to manipulate offers or payouts.</li>
          <li>Share illegal, harmful, or abusive content.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Suspension & Termination</h2>
        <p>
          We may suspend or terminate accounts, remove offers, or restrict access at our discretion if we believe 
          these Terms have been violated or if there is a risk to platform integrity.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Liability</h2>
        <p>
          EarnLibr provides the platform “as is” and makes no guarantees of uninterrupted or error-free operation. 
          We are not responsible for:

        <ul>
          <li>Services delivered by providers.</li>
          <li>Specific earnings amounts for promoters.</li>
          <li>Delays caused by external payment processors or third parties.</li>
        </ul>
